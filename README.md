# Quiz-App

This Quiz Site was an enjoyable educational exercise I created while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It contains a brief, interactive quiz of 3 questions, and was intended to assist me in learning to process user input, conditionals, and dynamic content modifications on the web.

I began by building a basic layout in HTML to present the questions and the options for multiple-choice responses. I needed the interface to be straightforward and simple to use, so I applied CSS styling to the quiz with simple buttons and a layout that responds well to different screen resolutions. This was my first experience with building something interactive that reacts based on user responses in real-time.

With JavaScript, I created the logic that stores the user's answers, verifies if they are correct, and computes the final score at the conclusion. I also included simple feedback for every question and a concluding results message after all questions have been responded to. This made me more familiar with functions, event listeners, and conditionals.

Although there are only 3 questions on the quiz, it was an excellent exercise in how to design interactive bits and manage the flow of a miniature app. I also toyed with various features such as preventing button presses after a selection is made, monitoring the current index of the question, and clearing the quiz for another attempt.

Through this project, I get a better feel of how the state is managed within a small web application and also how to update the DOM when a user does something. It feels great creating something that's not only workable but, at the same time, gives users a sense of progress and immediate feedback.

This quiz website might be simple, but it was a big step forward in my learning journey. It helped me bring together everything Iâ€™d been learning about web development and turn it into a fun and functional experience.
